# Dendunië

_Den-dunië_ = "language-hidden"

## Overview

Dendunië is mostly head-initial. Unmarked word order in main
clauses is VSO, though topics are often moved before the verb.
Subclauses tend to be verb-final. Adjectives, prepositions,
and relative clauses follow the noun they modify, though in
headed compounds the head comes last.

One interesting feature of Dendunië is that almost all
grammatical marking is optional. Markers of definiteness,
number, and tense can be omitted--and usually are, unless
there is a pragmatic reason to include them. Marking is
symmetric; that is, the least-marked form of a word has an
ambiguous or unspecified meaning; to form either the
singular or plural form of a noun you must modify the stem.
Additionally, all grammatical words and affixes have an
invariant written form. This avoids the problems of
English, where in order to accommodate multiple
possibilities you must use awkward constructions like
"book(s)", "he/she", "a/an" etc., as well as remember
strange edge cases like the fact that zero is used with the
plural suffix: "zero books".

## Nominal Morphology

The definite article is _iv_, the indefinite _mav_. In speech,
the _v_ of these articles is not pronounced before another
consonant, but this pronunciation change is not reflected in
writing. The v is always written.

The plural suffix is _rim_, the singular _das_.

iv ail "the bird(s)"
iv ailrim "the birds"
mav ailrim "some birds"
ail "bird" or "birds" or "a/the bird"
aildas "one bird" or "the one bird"

## Verbal Morphology

-ië   passive participle
-iant active participle
-i    middle participle
-ed   gerund
-uven perfective aspect
-ar   subjunctive
-ael  conditional

The subjunctive is used for unconditional hypotheticals, the
conditional for conditional ones. (TODO maybe the
subjunctive and conditional are both unnecessary?)



Tense is not marked morphologically, but can be suggested by
using time words like "tomorrow" or "last week".
