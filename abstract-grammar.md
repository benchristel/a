## Parts of Speech

There are only two lexical parts of speech:

- Articles, which anchor noun-like phrases that can play the
  _constituent_ role. Articles are a closed class.
- Adjectives, which do everything else. Adjectives can have
  constituents (much like verbs in other languages), be
  modified by other adjectives, and, when composed with
  articles, serve as nouns. Adjectives are an open class.

Syntactically, adjectives relate to articles and other
adjectives in a few different ways:

- Determiner/Apposite: a noun phrase is made up of an
  article (the determiner) and one or more apposite
  adjectives.
- Root/Apposite: the root of a sentence consists of a list
  of apposites--basically, a noun phrase with no determiner.
  The usual interpretation is subject/verb
- Predicate/Constituent: adjectives have a lexically-determined
  valence, which is a number of "slots" that can be filled
  by constituents. These constituents contribute to the
  meaning of the phrase. The word that accepts constituents
  is said to be in the role of "predicate" in relation to
  them. A constituent is a noun phrase (headed by an
  article)--never an adjective standing on its own.
- Head/Modifier: adjectives can be modified by any number of
  other adjectives.

Mo eldya vy bren darg
selflike having-seen-1 that-male-one royal red
"I have seen the red king"

It is important not to think of this in terms of
subject-verb-object. Apposites describe a situation, in
which the subject, the action, and the manner of the action
are not clearly distinguished. This becomes clear when we
start to express ideas that would be adverbs in English:

Mo yama sul hyd eld vy bren
selflike past sudden brief see-1 that royal
"I suddenly glimpsed the king"

Here, the first five words are all theoretically on equal
footing: they all specify some attribute of a situation.
One way of thinking of this is that they all describe a
temporally-bounded subject: the subject of the sentence is identified
as the speaker, is entirely in the past, came into existence suddenly
and existed briefly, and during this existence saw the king.

Another interpretation is that these are all
apposites of some invisible article that refers to a
situation. In this interpretation there is no focus on the
"subject", only on the situation.

And this second interpretation is arguably more correct.
After all, how else can we make sense of a sentence like

a shuru bi
that thirsty-0 slight
"He is slightly thirsty"

Where clearly it is not the "subject" that is slight, but
the situation of being thirsty. Really, a sentence like this
refers to the _interface_ between subject and situation.
