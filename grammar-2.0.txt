## Phonology

|           | Labial | Coronal | Dorsal | Glottal
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | -------
| Nasal     | m      | n       | ng     |
| Stop      | b      | t d     | c g    |
| Fricative | f v    | s z     | ch     | h
| Approx.   | w      |         | y      |
| Liquid    |        | l r     |        |


Vowels are a /A/, e /E/, i /I/, and o /O/.

Diphthongs are ay /aI/, ey /eI/, iy /6I/ and oy /oI/.

Syllable structure is (C)(L)V(C), where L is a liquid or
approximant.
A cross-syllable cluster may only form if the first
consonant is n, m, l, or r (n assimilates to the POA of
the consonant after it). An epenthetic schwa, spelled y,
is inserted to break up other clusters.

Additionally, stops cannot occur between vowels. An n or m
is inserted before any stop that would otherwise be between
two vowels.

lav + tal -> lavyntal
ceyr + dov -> ceyrdov
lang + del -> langyndel
ef + tri -> efyntri

Vowels may be in hiatus only if the first is i and the
second is not. Other vowel clusters are broken up with v:

efyntri + ay -> efyntriay
doro + en -> doroven
le + en -> leven

This even happens with diphthongs:

efay + en -> efayven
