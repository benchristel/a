# Niëldanen

Niëldanen is a language.

## Phonaesthetics

- Not too many consonant clusters; the types of clusters
that can exist are restricted.

- Many coronal consonants.

- Mostly voiceless consonants. Maybe voiced stops can only
exist in clusters, like in Quenya.

- Simple 5-vowel system. Diphthongs ai, ei, ae, maybe au,
oi, ui?

- Vowel clusters are common: cual, throen, niel, caiir
daier, maiur (note that i between two other vowels can be
abbreviated as a diaeresis in formats that allow it: caïr,
daër, maür.

## Phonology

The phonology is basically that of English--or rather,
"standard average fantasy european" languages by
English-speaking authors. The vowels are the five cardinal
vowels.

This is one area where I just don't see the point of being
creative. If you can't stand boring phonologies you can run
Nieldanen through whatever sound change rules you want. No
one's going to stop you.

## Orthography

/I/ and /j/ are both spelled y. This isn't ambiguous because
/I/ can't form diphthongs.

/k/ is spelled k before i or e, and c elsewhere.

/N/ is spelled ng at the end of a word. Elsewhere, ng is
pronounced /Ng/.

One rather odd thing: the diaeresis marks palatalization of
the previous sound. So sï is pronounced /Si/, and cü is
pronounced /tSu/.

picacü = "pikachu"
sÿlyng = "shilling"

## Phonotactics

Allowed syllable-final consonants are n, s, l, and r.

## Syntax

Basic sentence structure is copula-subject-predicate.  If
the subject is a pronoun, it is represented as an inflection
of the copula.

Lexical verbs and adjectives (predicates) are glossed as
participles.

```
COP-1SG hating boat-PL
I hate boats.
```

The copula is inflected for tense and mood. Aspect is
expressed with auxiliaries, or with inflections on the
predicate. (I'm still not sure how exactly this should work.
Maybe tense inflections should go on the predicate?)

```
COP-PAST-1SG PERF-eating rabbit over-night
I'd eaten a rabbit the previous day.
```

Topics are fronted.

The subjects of infinitives use the possessive inflection:

```
Ennia neir lithroen nin lijimal
COP-PAST-3SG wanting NOMINAL-bringing 1SG.POSS DEF pickaxe
They wanted me to bring the pickaxe.
```

The infinitive is also used for counterfactuals, where
Romance languages tend to use the conditional and
subjunctive:

```
va liye nin baroca, liye nin baroca lawsair
if NOMINAL-COP 1SG.POSS bear, NOMINAL-COP 1SG.POSS bear speaking
If I were a bear, I'd be a talking bear.
```

## Metaphor

Time flows upwards; the future is below us and the past is
above. When drawing a timeline, earlier events are placed at
the top and later events at the bottom.
