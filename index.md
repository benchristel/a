## Ideas I Like

- the last vowel followed by a consonant is stressed. In
  disyllables this stress is primary; in longer words it's
  secondary if on the final syllable.
- the basic form of a verb is the gerund, as in welsh and
  irish
- Old English phonology (though not phonotactics)
- Accents--whether for marking length or stress
- The final-e diaeresis used in Quenya is nice when e is a
  common final vowel.
- Regular table of correlatives: https://www.angelfire.com/empire/almaline/gram.html
- A proximal/distal tense distinction--more elegant than
  present/past, because the perfect doesn't seem totally
  orthogonal to the past, and proximal/distal generalizes to the
  subjunctive mood. It's almost a description of how tense
  works in English (with the exception that you could also
  use the distal for talking about the distant future. Not
  sure why you'd bother to talk about that, though).

## Ideas I don't like

- the repeated aj's and oj's in Esperanto look ridiculous.
  Adjectives shouldn't have to agree with nouns.
- verb endings that differ by a single vowel, e.g. in
  Esperanto or Almalinë. It seems like these would be too
  easy to mishear, and they feel very artificial.

## Design Principles

- It's okay to include phonemes that are rare. Just because
  /p/ is a phoneme doesn't mean it has to be used a lot!
- When in doubt, make the most obvious choice.

## Pronunciation

As in English: **b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, qu, sh, t, v, w, z**

Others:

- a /a/
- c /k/
- ch /x/ after a or o; /tS/ elsewhere
- dh, eth /D/
- e /E/
- g /g/
- i /i/
- j /dZ/
- hl /l\_0/
- ng /Ng/ intervocalically, /N/ elsewhere
- o /o/
- ph /f/
- r /r/
- hr /r\_0/
- s /s/
- th /T/
- u /u/
- y /I/ or /j/
- zh /Z/

The letter `w` represents the sound /u/ at the end of a word
or between vowels, e.g. *naru*.

The letter `y` is pronounced /j/ before a vowel. Note in
particular `yy` = /jI/.

## Diphthongs

Rising:

- ai /aI/
- ae /eI/
- ei /@I/
- oi /oI/
- au /aU/
- uy, wy /uI/

Falling:

- ui /wi/ or /ui/
- ya /ja/
- ye /je/
- yy /jI/
- yo /jo/
- yu, yw /ju/

## Stress

Two-syllable words are stressed on the last syllable if they
end in a consonant, and on the first syllable if they end in
a vowel:

- *enér* "here"
- *náru* "vision"

Words of three or more syllables are stressed on the
third-to-last syllable unless the second-to-last vowel
is long, in which case it gets the stress.

## Morphology

Verbs have the following forms:

Imperative -a
Gerund     -tas
Active Participle  -iel
Passive Participle -ien
Present            -a
Past               -nne
Aorist (present habitual) -ea
Imperfect (past habitual) -ia
Future/Conditional        -ave

Dwl astaea pen glaer "rain comes every summer"
Dwl astia pen glaer "rain came (/ would come) every summer"
Dwl astannë i glaer anta "rain came that summer"

Hypothetical scenarios are described with *davien* "given"
(a paraphrase for "if") and a gerund:

"given my being a bear, I will be (future/conditional) a
talking bear"

Davien ne sintas mejel ni, sinaven mejel vrethiel
