## Ideas I Like

- the last vowel followed by a consonant is stressed. In
  disyllables this stress is primary; in longer words it's
  secondary if on the final syllable.
- the basic form of a verb is the gerund, as in welsh and
  irish
- Old English phonology (though not phonotactics)
- Accents--whether for marking length or stress
- The final-e diaeresis used in Quenya is nice when e is a
  common final vowel.
- Regular table of correlatives: https://www.angelfire.com/empire/almaline/gram.html
- A proximal/distal tense distinction--more elegant than
  present/past, because the perfect doesn't seem totally
  orthogonal to the past, and proximal/distal generalizes to the
  subjunctive mood. It's almost a description of how tense
  works in English (with the exception that you could also
  use the distal for talking about the distant future. Not
  sure why you'd bother to talk about that, though).

## Ideas I don't like

- the repeated aj's and oj's in Esperanto look ridiculous.
  Adjectives shouldn't have to agree with nouns.
- verb endings that differ by a single vowel, e.g. in
  Esperanto or Almalinë. It seems like these would be too
  easy to mishear, and they feel very artificial.

## Design Principles

- It's okay to include phonemes that are rare. Just because
  /p/ is a phoneme doesn't mean it has to be used a lot!
- When in doubt, make the most obvious choice.

## Culture and Metaphor

The future is down; the past is up.

To say "I like this," you'd say _suila ned ener anin_ "this
thing is like me". Resemblance is affinity.

## Pronunciation

As in English: **b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, qu, sh, t, v, w, z**

Others:

- a /a/
- c /k/
- ch /x/ after a or o; /tS/ elsewhere
- dh, eth /D/
- e /E/
- g /g/
- i /i/
- j /dZ/
- hl /l\_0/
- ng /Ng/ intervocalically, /N/ elsewhere
- o /o/
- ph /f/
- r /r/
- hr /r\_0/
- s /s/
- th /T/
- u /u/
- y /I/ or /j/
- zh /Z/

The letter `w` represents the sound /u/ at the end of a word
or between vowels, e.g. *naru*.

The letter `y` is pronounced /j/ before a vowel. Note in
particular `yy` = /jI/.

## Diphthongs

Rising:

- ai /aI/
- ae /eI/
- ei /@I/
- oi /oI/
- au /aU/
- uy, wy /uI/

Falling:

- ui /wi/ or /ui/
- ya /ja/
- ye /je/
- yy /jI/
- yo /jo/
- yu, yw /ju/

## Stress

Two-syllable words are stressed on the last syllable if they
end in a consonant, and on the first syllable if they end in
a vowel:

- *enér* "here"
- *náru* "vision"

Words of three or more syllables are stressed on the
third-to-last syllable unless the second-to-last vowel
is long, in which case it gets the stress.

## Noun Phrases

Modifiers (adjectives, prepositional phrases, and relative
clauses) follow the noun they modify.

i'niel ener "this forest"
niel o naru "a forest from a vision"

## Possession

There are two possessive forms, indicating different types
of possession.

The specialized form, the genitive, is formed with the
suffix -ir. Genitive nouns are placed after the noun they
modify. The genitive is used to indicate relationships of
creation:

niel Yamair "Yama's forest (Yama grew the forest)"

The other form, the possessive, is used for all other
relationships. The possessor comes second and gets marked
with a suffix -o which replaces a final -a.

niel Yamo "a forest of Yama"
