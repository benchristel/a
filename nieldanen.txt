# Niëldanen

Niëldanen is a language.

## Phonaesthetics

- Not too many consonant clusters; the types of clusters
that can exist are restricted.

- Many coronal consonants.

- Mostly voiceless consonants. Maybe voiced stops can only
exist in clusters, like in Quenya.

- Simple 5-vowel system. Diphthongs ai, ei, ae, maybe au,
oi, ui?

- Vowel clusters are common: cual, throen, niel, caiir
daier, maiur (note that i between two other vowels can be
abbreviated as a diaeresis in formats that allow it: caïr,
daër, maür.

## Phonology (X-SAMPA)

Vowels

| ---- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| High | i     | I       | u     |
| Low  | e     | a       | o     |

## Orthography

/I/ and /j/ are both spelled y. This isn't ambiguous because
/I/ can't form diphthongs.

/k/ is spelled k before i or e, and c elsewhere.

/N/ is spelled ng at the end of a word. Elsewhere, ng is
pronounced /Ng/.

One rather odd thing: the diaeresis marks palatalization of
the previous sound. So sï is pronounced /Si/, and cü is
pronounced /tSu/.

picacü = "pikachu"
sÿlyng = "shilling"

## Stress

In two-syllable words, stress falls on the last vowel that
has a consonant after it.

In words of three or more syllables, stress falls on the
second-to-last vowel if that is a diphthong or is followed
by two consonants, or on the third-to-last vowel otherwise.

## Morphology

### Nouns

The

i niel "the forest"
i nielden "the forests"
i nieldath "all the forests"
i canathen "the calls"
i canad "the call"
i canad nieldas "the call of (from) the forest"
Galdor niravas i canad nieldas
Galdor cu niravas i

Udaer Galdor niras i raith i nieldin
Not-is Galdor wanting-LOC the path the forest-DAT

The plural marker is -en after a consonant, -ven after o or
u, and -n after another vowel. The singular suffix is -(o)s;
it is usually omitted except when nominalizing a verb.

### Personal pronouns:

Subject (only used for emphasis; use inflections on the
copula instead)

Person        | Singular | Plural
------------- | -------- | ------
1st Exclusive | ni       | vi
1st Inclusive | -        | elu
2nd Familiar  | kel      | -
2nd Regular   | tel      | telen
3rd Proximal  | ri       | dri
3rd Distal    | sï       | tsï

Object:

Person        | Singular | Plural
------------- | -------- | ------
1st Exclusive | anim     | avin
1st Inclusive | -        | alu
2nd Familiar  | akel     | -
2nd Regular   | athel    | atheln

Possessive Prefixes:

Person        | Singular | Plural
------------- | -------- | ------
1st Exclusive | ny       | vy
1st Inclusive | -        | ly
2nd Familiar  | ky       | -
2nd Regular   | ty       | ty
3rd Proximal  | ry       | dry
3rd Distal    | sÿ       | tsÿ

Possessive prefixes allow nominalized verbs to drop
the -os suffix.

> kynaër(os) "your dream"
> drynaëren "their dreams"

The -y of these prefixes is dropped when the possessed noun
begins in a vowel.

> n'aras "my deer"

Note that the palatalization is kept when dropping a vowel
of a third-person distal affix:

> ts'äras "their deer"

There is also a "general" possessive prefix y-.  This
doesn't imply any specific person or number; the meaning is
left up to context.

> ynaër "my dream"

A noun can be made into a predicate (adjective) by suffixing
-ve.

### Verbs

The _copula_ is the element of the sentence that inflects
for person, number, and tense. It has no meaning on its own,
though it can be paraphrased "is" or "are".

```
Eön naër ve loroven
Eön     naër  ve    loro-ven
1SG.COP dream about boat-PL
I dream about boats
```

The predicate following a copula need not be a "verb" in the
English sense. It can be a preposition-like word.
Prepositions and verbs are members of the same class in
Nieldanen.

```
Eön ve loro
1SG.COP on boat
I am on a boat
```

The word order of a sentence is usually
subject-copula-verb-object. But when the subject is a
pronoun, it is usually omitted. The copula is inflected for
the person and number of the subject, so the pronoun is
redundant.

Present tense:

             | Singular | Plural |
------------ | -------- | ------ |
1st Excl.    | en       | aev    |
1st Incl.    | -        | ael    |
2nd Familiar | ec       | -      |
2nd Regular  | eth      | aeth   |
3rd Proximal | e        | ae     |
3rd Distal   | es       | aes    |

Past tense:

             | Singular | Plural |
------------ | -------- | ------ |
1st Excl.    | eön      | eäv    |
1st Incl.    | -        | eäl    |
2nd Familiar | eöc      | -      |
2nd Regular  | eöth     | eäth   |
3rd Proximal | eö       | eä     |
3rd Distal   | eös      | eäs    |


Consider: erav, eral, etc. for plurals?

Eav tothran o loroven


Gerunds are formed by suffixing -(e)th or -u. The -eth
suffix implies a general concept, while -u implies a
specific action.

## Syntax

Basic sentence structure is subject-copula-predicate.  If
the subject is a pronoun, it is represented as an inflection
of the copula.

Transitive predicates are followed by their objects.

Lexical verbs and adjectives (predicates) are glossed as
participles.

The passive is formed like so:

```
En tothra o loroven
COP.1SG disgust-PAT GEN boat-PL
I am a disgustee of boats
I hate boats.
```

Since the passive "verb" is actually nominalized with -ra
(which functions similarly to the suffix -ee in English,
e.g. "employee"), it must agree in number with the subject:

```
Aev tothran o loroven
COP.1PL.EXCL disgust-PAT-PL GEN boat-PL
We hate boats.
```

The copula is inflected for tense and mood. Aspect is
expressed with auxiliaries, or with inflections on the
predicate. (I'm still not sure how exactly this should work.
Maybe tense inflections should go on the predicate?)

```
Eönai girannen fienai veldu
COP.1SG-PAST eat-PERF rabbit over-night
I'd eaten a rabbit the previous day.
```

Topics are fronted.

The subjects of infinitives use the possessive inflection:

```
Ennia neir nythroen eljimal
COP.PAST.3SG wanting 1SG.POSS-bringing DEF-pickaxe
They wanted me to bring the pickaxe.
```

The infinitive is also used for counterfactuals, where
Romance languages tend to use the conditional and
subjunctive:

```
if NOMINAL-COP 1SG.POSS bear, NOMINAL-COP 1SG.POSS bear speaking
If I were a bear, I'd be a talking bear.
```

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding a particle _ma_ to the
beginning of the sentence. If a specific constituent is
being questioned, _ma_ is placed after that constituent.

Content questions are formed by replacing the questioned
element with _man_ "what, who" or _manwe_ "how".

## Metaphor

Time flows upwards; the future is below us and the past is
above. When drawing a timeline, earlier events are placed at
the top and later events at the bottom.
