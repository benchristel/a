# Aeingich

Aeingich is a language spoken by the _Aeingra_ or Aeings,
inhabitants of an island called Aeingland off the western
coast of Europe.

## Phonology

## Spelling

In a syllable coda consisting of a single vowel and a
consonant, the vowel is pronounced short:

- wit /wIt/
- lyk /l@k/
- tuk /tUk/
- lot /lOt/
- ken /kEn/
- kan /k{n/

In a syllable that does not end in a consonant, the vowel
is pronounced long. An exception is e, which is reduced
to a schwa at the end of a word.

- hi /hi/
- ty /tI/
- nu /nu/
- lote /lot@/
- dene /den@/
- maro /maro/

## Phonological Processes

### Vowel Strengthening

Vowel strengthening turns a vowel into a diphthong:

- i -> ei
- y -> ei
- u -> iu or ui
- o -> au
- e -> ae
- a -> ae or au

Which diphthong a and u strengthen to is determined
lexically.

## Nominal Morphology

The plural of nouns is formed by suffixing -ra. This
causes the following assimilations:

- -tr- -> -r-
- -dr- -> -r-
- -sr- -> -r-
- -nr- -> -ndr-
- -mr- -> -mbr-
- -lr- -> -ldr-

The definite article is t'.

> t'bane "the bone"

Agents are formed from verbs with the suffix -syrd.
This causes the following assimilations and spelling
changes:

- -ts- -> -z-
- -ds- -> -z-
- -rs- -> -z-
- -ks- -> -x-
- -ns- -> -nts-
- -ms- -> -mps-
- -ngs- -> -nx-

> wit "knowing" -> wizyrd "knower"

> lak "being poor" -> laxyrd "poor person"

Additionally, after a consonant cluster, -syrd shortens
to -yrd:

> farm "farming" -> farmyrd "farmer"

Some words are formed from a worn-down agentive construction
in -(s)yr. These tend to be inanimate objects.

> wat "wetting" -> watyr "water"

Gerunds are formed by strengthening the verb's vowel, or
(for some verbs) appending an -e.

> farm "farming" -> faerm "to farm"

The -e suffix sometimes changes the final vowel of the verb
stem:

> wit "knowing" -> wise "knowledge"

Habych t'wise "I have known"
Gannen of me 's t'wise "I've forgotten"
Eo wit thet "I know that"
Eo wit thera "I know those"
Eo na wise "I am knowing"
Eo kom na t'wise thes "I am learning it / I shall know it"
Eo'l wise "I will know / I want to know"
